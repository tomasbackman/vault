# Configuration

~> **Important Note:** This chart is not compatible with Helm 3. Please use Helm 2 with this chart.

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Vault. Before going into production, please review the parameters below
and consider if they're appropriate for your deployment.

- `global` - These global values affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - The master enabled/disabled configuration. If this is true, most components will be installed by default. If this is false, no components will be installed by default and manually opting-in is required, such as by setting `server.enabled` to true.

  - `imagePullSecrets` (`string: ""`) - Defines secrets to be used when pulling images from private registries.

    - `name`: (`string: required`) - Name of the secret containing files required for authentication to private image registries.

  - `tlsDisable` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, changes URLs from `https` to `http` (such as the `VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` environment variable set on the Vault pods).

- `injector` - Values that configure running a Vault Agent Injector Admission Webhook Controller within Kubernetes.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, the Vault Agent Injector Admission Webhook controller will be created.

  - `image` - Values that configure the Vault Agent Injector Docker image.

    - `repository` (`string: "hashicorp/vault-k8s"`) - The name of the Docker image for Vault Agent Injector.

    - `tag` (`string: "0.2.0"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the Vault Agent Injector. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.** Otherwise, other changes to the chart may inadvertently upgrade your admission controller.

    - `pullPolicy` (`string: "IfNotPresent"`) - The pull policy for container images. The default pull policy is `IfNotPresent` which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exists.

  - `agentImage` - Values that configure the Vault Agent sidecar image.

    - `repository` (`string: "vault"`) - The name of the Docker image for the Vault Agent sidecar. This should be set to the official Vault Docker image.

    - `tag` (`string: "1.3.1"`) - The tag of the Vault Docker image to use for the Vault Agent Sidecar. **Vault 1.3.1+ is required by the admission controller**.

  - `resources` (`string: ""`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each of the server. This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources.<br /> **Setting this is highly recommended.**

    ```yaml
    # Resources are defined as a formatted multi-line string:
    resources: |
      requests:
        memory: "10Gi"
      limits:
        memory: "10Gi"
    ```

  - `namespaceSelector` (`string: ""`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what namespaces where injection can happen. If set to null, all non-system namespaces are eligible for injection.

    ```yaml
    # Selectors are defined as a formatted multi-line string.
    # In this example, all namespaces with the label "injection: enabled" are eligible:
    namespaceSelector: |
      matchLabels:
        injection: enabled
    ```

  - `certs` - The certs section configures how the webhook TLS certs are configured. These are the TLS certs for the Kube apiserver communicating to the webhook. By default, the injector will generate and manage its own certs, but this requires the ability for the injector to update its own `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`. In a production environment, custom certs should probably be used. Configure the values below to enable this.

    - `secretName` (`string: ""`) - secretName is the name of the Kubernetes secret that has the TLS certificate and private key to serve the injector webhook. If this is null, then the injector will default to its automatic management mode.

    - `caBundle` (`string: ""`) - The PEM-encoded CA public certificate bundle for the TLS certificate served by the injector. This must be specified as a string and can't come from a secret because it must be statically configured on the Kubernetes `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` resource. This only needs to be specified if `secretName` is not null.

    - `certName` (`string: "tls.crt"`) - The name of the certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

    - `keyName` (`string: "tls.key"`) - The name of the key file within the `secretName` secret.

- `server` - Values that configure running a Vault server within Kubernetes.

  - `image` - Values that configure the Vault Docker image.

    - `repository` (`string: "vault"`) - The name of the Docker image for the containers running Vault.

    - `tag` (`string: "1.3.1"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the containers running Vault. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.** Otherwise, other changes to the chart may inadvertently upgrade your admission controller.

    - `pullPolicy` (`string: "IfNotPresent"`) - The pull policy for container images. The default pull policy is `IfNotPresent` which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exists.

    - `resources` (`string: null`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each of the server. This should be a multi-line string mapping directly to a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources. **Setting this is highly recommended.**

      ```yaml
      # Resources are defined as a formatted multi-line string:
      resources: |
        requests:
          memory: "10Gi"
        limits:
          memory: "10Gi"
      ```

    * `ingress` - Values that configure Ingress services for Vault.

      enabled: true
      path: /v1/sys/health?standbyok=true
    ```

    - `livelinessProbes` - Values that configure the liveliness probe for the Vault pods.

          secretName: vault
          secretKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ```

    - `extraVolumes` (`array: []`) - A list of extra volumes to mount to Vault servers. This is useful for bringing in extra data that can be referenced by other configurations at a well known path, such as TLS certificates. The value of this should be a list of objects. Each object supports the following keys:

      - `type` (`string: required`) -
        Type of the volume, must be one of "configMap" or "secret". Case sensitive.

      - `name` (`string: required`) -
        Name of the configMap or secret to be mounted. This also controls the path
        that it is mounted to. The volume will be mounted to `/vault/userconfig/<name>` by default
        unless `path` is configured.

      - `path` (`string: /vault/userconfigs`) -
        Name of the path where a configMap or secret is mounted. If not specified
        the volume will be mounted to `/vault/userconfig/<name of volume>`.

          name: 'vault-certs'
          path: '/etc/pki'
      ```

    - `affinity` - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) for server pods. It defaults to allowing only a single pod on each node, which minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value to `null`.

    ```yaml
    # Recommended default server affinity:
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: {{ template "vault.name" . }}
            release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
            component: server
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    ```

      - key: 'node.kubernetes.io/unreachable'
        operator: 'Exists'
        effect: 'NoExecute'
        tolerationSeconds: 6000
    ```

    - `nodeSelector` - This value defines additional node selection criteria for more control over where the Vault servers are deployed.

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector:
      disktype: ssd
    ```

    - `extraLabels` - This value defines additional labels for server pods. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

      "sample/label1": "foo"
      "sample/label2": "bar"
    ```

    - `annotations` - This value defines additional annotations for server pods. This should be a formatted as a multi-line string.

    ```yaml
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, a Kubernetes service will be created for Vault.

      - `clusterIP` (`string`) - ClusterIP controls whether an IP address (cluster IP) is attached to the Vault service within Kubernetes. By default the Vault service will be given a Cluster IP address, set to `None` to disable. When disabled Kubernetes will create a "headless" service. Headless services can be used to communicate with pods directly through DNS instead of a round robin load balancer.

      - `type` (`string: "ClusterIP"`) - Sets the type of service to create, such as `NodePort`.

      - `port` (`int: 8200`) - Port on which Vault server is listening inside the pod.

      - `targetPort` (`int: 8200`) - Port on which the service is listening.

      - `nodePort` (`int:`) - When type is set to `NodePort`, the bound node port can be configured using this value. A random port will be assigned if this is left blank.

      - `annotations` (`string`) - This value defines additional annotations for the service. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

    - `serviceAccount` - Values that configure the Kubernetes service account created for Vault.

      - `annotations` (`string`) - This value defines additional annotations for the service account. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

      ```yaml
      annotations: |
        "sample/annotation1": "foo"
        "sample/annotation2": "bar"
      ```

    - `extraVolumes` - This configures the `Service` resource created for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables a service to allow other pods running in Kubernetes to communicate with the Vault server.

    - `dataStorage` - This configures the volume used for storing Vault data when not using external storage such as Consul.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables a persistent volume to be created for storing Vault data when not using an external storage service.

      - `size` (`string: 10Gi`) -
        Size of the volume to be created for Vault's data storage when not using an external storage service.

      - `storageClass` (`string: null`) -
        Name of the storage class to use when creating the data storage volume.

      - `accessMode` (`string: ReadWriteOnce`) -
        Type of access mode of the storage device. See the [official Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes) for more information.

    - `auditStorage` - This configures the volume used for storing Vault's audit logs. See the [Vault documentation](/docs/audit) for more information.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables a persistent volume to be created for storing Vault's audit logs.

      - `size` (`string: 10Gi`) -
        Size of the volume to be created for Vault's audit logs.

      - `storageClass` (`string: null`) -
        Name of the storage class to use when creating the audit storage volume.

      - `accessMode` (`string: ReadWriteOnce`) -
        Type of access mode of the storage device.

    - `dev` - This configures `dev` mode for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) -
        Enables `dev` mode for the Vault server. This mode is useful for experimenting with Vault without needing to unseal.

      ~> **Security Warning:** Never, ever, ever run a "dev" mode server in production. It is insecure and will lose data on every restart (since it stores data in-memory). It is only made for development or experimentation.

    - `standalone` - This configures `standalone` mode for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables `standalone` mode for the Vault server. This mode uses the `file` storage backend and requires a volume for persistence (`dataStorage`).

      - `config` (`string: "{}"`) -
        A raw string of extra HCL or JSON [configuration](/docs/configuration) for Vault servers.
        This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Vault servers.
        This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

      ```yaml
      # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
      config: |
        api_addr = "http://POD_IP:8200"

        listener "tcp" {
          tls_disable = 1
          address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
        }

        storage "file" {
          path = "/vault/data"
        }
      ```

      This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (vault-helm v0.1.0 and later), using the following syntax:

      ```shell
      --set server.standalone.config='{ listener "tcp" { address = "0.0.0.0:8200" }'
      ```

    - `ha` - This configures `ha` mode for the Vault server.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) -
        Enables `ha` mode for the Vault server. This mode uses a highly available backend storage (such as Consul) to store Vault's data. By default this is configured to use [Consul Helm](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-helm). For a complete list of storage backends, see the [Vault documentation](/docs/configuration).

      - `replicas` (`int: 5`) -
        The number of pods to deploy to create a highly available cluster of Vault servers.

      - `updatePartition` (`int: 0`) -
        If an updatePartition is specified, all Pods with an ordinal that is greater than or equal to the partition will be updated when the StatefulSet’s `.spec.template` is updated. If set to `0`, this disables parition updates. For more information see the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates).

      - `config` (`string: "{}"`) -
        A raw string of extra HCL or JSON [configuration](/docs/configuration) for Vault servers.
        This will be saved as-is into a ConfigMap that is read by the Vault servers.
        This can be used to add additional configuration that isn't directly exposed by the chart.

      ```yaml
      # ExtraConfig values are formatted as a multi-line string:
      config: |
        ui = true
        api_addr = "http://POD_IP:8200"
        listener "tcp" {
            tls_disable = 1
            address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
        }

        storage "consul" {
            path = "vault"
            address = "HOST_IP:8500"
        }
      ```

      This can also be set using Helm's `--set` flag (vault-helm v0.1.0 and later), using the following syntax:

      ```shell
      --set server.ha.config='{ listener "tcp" { address = "0.0.0.0:8200" }'
      ```

    * `disruptionBudget` - Values that configures the disruption budget policy. See the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) for more information.

      - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) -
        Enables disruption budget policy to limit the number of pods that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions.

      - `maxUnavailable` (`int: null`) -
        The maximum number of unavailable pods. By default, this will be automatically
        computed based on the `server.replicas` value to be `(n/2)-1`. If you need to set
        this to `0`, you will need to add a `--set 'server.disruptionBudget.maxUnavailable=0'`
        flag to the helm chart installation command because of a limitation in the Helm
        templating language.

- `ui` - Values that configure the Vault UI.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) - If true, the UI will be enabled. The UI will only be enabled on Vault servers. If `server.enabled` is false, then this setting has no effect. To expose the UI in some way, you must configure `ui.service`.

  - `serviceType` (`string: ClusterIP`) -
    The service type to register. This defaults to `ClusterIP`.
    The available service types are documented on
    [the Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

  - `serviceNodePort` (`int: null`) -
    Sets the Node Port value when using `serviceType: NodePort` on the Vault UI service.

  - `externalPort` (`int: 8200`) -
    Sets the external port value of the service.

  - `loadBalancerSourceRanges` (`string`) - This value defines additional source CIDRs when using `serviceType: LoadBalancer`. This should be formatted as a multi-line string.

  ```yaml
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:
    - 10.0.0.0/16
    - 120.78.23.3/32
  ```

  - `loadBalancerIP` (`string`) - This value defines the IP address of the load balancer when using `serviceType: LoadBalancer`.

  - `annotations` (`string`) - This value defines additional annotations for the UI service. This should be a formatted as a multi-line string.

  ```yaml
  annotations: |
    "sample/annotation1": "foo"
    "sample/annotation2": "bar"
  ```
