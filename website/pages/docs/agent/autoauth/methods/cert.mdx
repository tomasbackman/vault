# Vault Agent Auto-Auth Cert Method

The `cert` method uses the configured TLS certificates from the `vault` stanza of
the agent configuration and takes an optional `name` parameter. There is no option
to use certificates which differ from those used in the `vault` stanza.

See TLS settings in the [`vault` Stanza](/docs/agent#vault-stanza)

## Configuration

- `name` `(string: optional)` - The trusted certificate role which should be used
  when authenticating with TLS. If a `name` is not specified, the auth method will
  try to authenticate against [all trusted certificates](/docs/auth/cert#authentication).
